// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

// Define a function to create a car object with optional option
function create_car(manufacture,model,...options){
// Initialize a car object with manufacture and model
let car = {
    manufacture: manufacture,
    model: model,
};

// Add additional option to the car object
options.forEach(option => {
    let [key, value] = option.split(":");
    car[key.trim()] = value.trim();
});
return car;
}

// Call the function to create a car object
let my_car = create_car("Toyota","Corolla","color:Black","Sunroof: True");

console.log(my_car);
